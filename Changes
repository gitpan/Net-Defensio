Revision history for Net-Defensio

0.02   Thu Nov 15 17:00:00 PST 2007

 *  Added YAML::Tiny as a requirement, since that's all that is supported
    currently. Support for XML and using YAML / YAML::Syck is planned.
 *  Disabled tests for report-false-positives, report-false-negatives since
    Defensio API doesn't store signatures for test data yet.
